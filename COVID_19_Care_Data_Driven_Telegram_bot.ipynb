In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard. The most common symptoms of covid-19 viruses are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. The following are the safety practice to be followed to prevent the spread of covid-19 viruses such as Clean your hands often, Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub,Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing,Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.The covid 19 virus originated from chinese town yuhan. The disease later spread to america, italy. Today the disease the is spread all over the world! In tamil nadu the total covid-19 cases crosses 2 lakhs and the active cases in tamil nadu is around 50,000.\"\"\""
